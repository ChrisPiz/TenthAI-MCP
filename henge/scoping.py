"""Scoping phase — multi-step pipeline.

v0.6 pipeline:
  1. Haiku 4.5 [Anthropic] generates 4-7 base scoping questions.
  2. gpt-5 [OpenAI] adversarial review: 2-4 additional questions that
     challenge unexamined assumptions in the original question.
  3. Combined set returns to user.
  4. User responds (handled by server.py).
  5. Opus 4.7 [Anthropic] canonicalizes the user's responses into a
     summary + flags any inconsistencies.

Feature flags (env, default ``true``):
  - ``HENGE_ENABLE_ADVERSARIAL_SCOPING`` — skip step 2 if set to ``false``.
  - ``HENGE_ENABLE_CANONICAL_CONTEXT`` — skip step 5 if set to ``false``.

Cross-lab rationale: Haiku and Opus are Anthropic; gpt-5 is OpenAI. If Haiku
has a systematic bias about what counts as a "good scoping question", gpt-5
catches it from a different reasoning lineage.

The answers will feed 9 advisors with distinct cognitive angles: empirical (data, numbers), historical (precedents, cases), first-principles (constraints), analogical, systemic (second-order), ethical (stakeholders), contrarian (assumptions), pre-mortem (failure modes), optimist (upside).

Look for questions that cover (when relevant to the domain):
- Personal quantitative data (income, savings, deadlines, debts, age, dependents)
- Constraints and deal-breakers
- Geography, community, location
- Relationships and affected stakeholders
- Subjective preferences, life philosophy, priorities
- Information NOT already in the original question

Rules:
- 4-7 questions, no more, no less.
- Each concrete, specific to the domain. NOT generic.
- One question per entry — no "and"-compound questions.
- DO NOT repeat information already in the question.
- Match the language of the original question.
